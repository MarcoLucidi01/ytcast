- [ ] add flag to add videos to playing queue (`-a`).
- [ ] add flag to clear devices cache (`-c`). can be used with other flags?
- [ ] add flag to disconnect from device (`-d`)? not a priority.
- [ ] allow to play videos from specific timestamp? might be useful.
- [ ] add install target to makefile.
- [ ] allow `-s` to be used with `-l` and `-n` i.e. search and play.
- [ ] fix the ping and wakeup issue (see TODO in ytcast.go)
